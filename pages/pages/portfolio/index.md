### Data Structures in JavaScript using Test-Driven Development
[![Image](http://i.imgur.com/5MWwigs.png)](https://github.com/minseokim/data-structures-tdd)

##### Technologies Used :
- **Mocha.js** for running tests
- **Chai** for assertions

Learn to write unit tests and review data structures at the same time! [*This Project*](https://github.com/minseokim/data-structures-tdd) is a library that you can use to learn to implement data structures in JavaScript in your local environment while at the same time utilizing TDD(Test-Driven-Development). It supports common data structures such as binary search trees(balanced/unbalanced), heaps, circular arrays, graphs and tries. I created the entire testing spec/each implementation from scratch because I wanted to review data structures while practicing TDD and writing unit tests.

- **Redux** for state management
- **Jest, and Enzyme** for testing
- **Bootstrap** for UI

[*Query Generator*](https://minseokim.github.io/query-generator) is a simple JSON Query generator based on a given schema - It was completed in 72 hours as part of a coding challenge, so it was built with functionality in mind with **minimal focus on UI(Bootstrap was used)**.

The query accepts a `table name`, `start/end time`(in UNIX Epoch Format), `select_fields`, and a `where_clause` that will be dynamically generated depending on its parameters(`AND/OR`, etc).

It's **fully responsive** across all devices, and on Chrome uses a service worker for faster page load on repeated visits, and **even works offline!**

#### Technologies Used :
- **HTML5/SCSS**

[*Sayspeaking*](https://sayspeaking.com) is an online platform where students can take Korean conversation classes with trained tutors. I inherited the legacy project which was a themeforest template, and prototyped/developed the UI while at the same time refactoring most of the front-end codebase to reduce technical debt and allow for scalability/maintainability.
