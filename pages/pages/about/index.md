Hey there, I'm Minseo(Alex). I'm an nyc-based entrepreneur and software engineer who loves building neat things on the web.

I'm an avid traveler who's backpacked all across South America(Favorite spot by far : Uyuni Salt Desert), a fitness fanatic and lover of Puer tea.

In my spare time I enjoy lifting, watching college hoops, listening to podcasts. I'll be writing about tech, fitness, productivity, travel, and more. Check back for more updates!
